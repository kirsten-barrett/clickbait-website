      <h2>Spongebob</h2>
      <p>Spongebob is not a natural sea sponge.  Look at all the other sponges in bikini bottom - they’re all naturally shaped.  Spongebob Squarepants is perfectly yellow and square; just look at his parents!  It’s rumored that a sailor, driven mad by scurvy, took his only sponge on deck and slapped eyes and a mouth on it.  He worked tirelessly to create a robot brain out of scrap metal but he never succeeded.  He then threw his creation overboard with frustration.  Little does he know his robot sponge grew a personality and bought some pineapple real estate in bikini bottom!</p>

      <h2>Squidward</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, Squidward’s rumor is more sad than anything else.  It’s said that Squidward had a child in his early 20s but he wasn’t ready for the commitment.  He wanted freedom so he simply left the mother and the child.  They lived off the coast of Maine but he moved far, far away to the bikini bottom to avoid his responsibilities.  The real reason he hates the sound of Spongebob and Patrick playing and being childish is because it fills him with his rotten memory and regret.</p>

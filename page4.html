      <h2>Sandy Cheeks</h2>
      <p>Everyone sees her as a sweet country gal from Texas.  She’s a sweetheart in the town because she came from North America and was welcomed to bikini bottom after making nice with the towns people.  However, very few know of her dark past.  Truth is, she’s never even lived in Texas. She was a top-tier business woman from New York City. She traveled all the way to bikini bottom because it was her last option, she was avoiding arrest for tax evasion!</p>

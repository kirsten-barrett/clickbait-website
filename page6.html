      <h2>Plankton</h2>
      <p>Many know of Plankton for his bad attitude and thievery.  However, he has an even darker secret that is hardly known.  Plankton is actually the Jeff Besos of bikini bottom.  He is filthy rich - no wonder Mr. Krabs is always smelling money from across the street. The bad part though, is that he made his billions off of the ideas of his robot wife, Karen.  Even worse he keeps her hidden from the world in the Chum Bucket and only pretends to be in love when people come to visit.  Ever wondered why he lives so lavishly but never has customers?</p>
